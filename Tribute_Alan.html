<div class="text-justify">
	<ul>
		<li><p><strong>1912:</strong> 23rd June Born in Maida Vale, London, England, United Kingdom</p></li>
		<li><p><strong>1931:</strong> Turing reformulated Kurt Gödel's results on the limits of proof and computation, replacing Gödel's universal arithmetic-based formal language with <br>the formal and simple hypothetical devices that became known as Turing machines<br></p></li>
		<li><p><strong>1935:</strong> elected a fellow of King's on the strength of a dissertation in which he proved the central limit theorem </p></li>
		<li><p><strong>1936:</strong> published paper "On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem" </p></li>
		<li><p><strong>1938:</strong> obtained his PhD from Princeton</p></li>
		<li><p><strong>1940:</strong> Alan Turing devised Bombe was used successfully to break messages enciphered on the simpler Enigma system used by the German Air Force.</p></li>
		<li><p><strong>1942:</strong> worked with US Navy cryptanalysts on the naval Enigma and bombe construction in Washingtondevised a technique termed Turingery  for use against<br> the Lorenz cipher messages produced by the Germans' new Geheimschreiber (secret writer) machine.<br></p></li>
		<li><p><strong>1946:</strong> Turing was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) by King George VI for his wartime services. <br>He presented a paper on the first detailed design of a stored-program computer<br></p></li>
		<li><p><strong>1947:</strong> He returned to Cambridge for a sabbatical year during which he produced a seminal work on Intelligent Machinery </p></li>
		<li><p><strong>1953:</strong> Alan Turing is credited with designing the first computer chess program</p></li>
		<li><p><strong>1954:</strong> June 8 Died by Cyanide poisoning</p></li>
		<li><p><strong>2012:</strong> June 23rd Celebrating his 100th Birthday  Google featured an interactive doodle where visitors had to change the instructions of a Turing Machine, <br>so when run, the symbols on the tape would match a provided sequence, featuring "Google" in Baudot-Murray code.<br></p></li>
